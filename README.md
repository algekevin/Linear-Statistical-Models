# Linear-Statistical-Models
Some homework from a graduate course on Linear Statistical Models, as well as "coding challenges". Book used was Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) and a bit of ISLR.

Not all of the homework for this class had R components (most did, though). That is the reason why some homework numbers may be missing, such as hw1, hw2, hw4.
